**This is what I worked on:**

- I updated my personal branch and deleted non-essential documents. These documents, which are not essential to me, are registered in the branch of the first release where they belong.

---
**This is what I am working on:**

- the project tools.

---
**This is what I am going to work on:**

- the project script.

---
**This is what I could not work on:**

- I could not finish the project tools due to my lack of knowledge on the subject, so I will refine my knowledge the next day and finish the work. I hope to be able to work on the project script tomorrow.
