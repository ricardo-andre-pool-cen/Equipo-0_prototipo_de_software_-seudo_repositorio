## PROCESS DESCRIPTION, THIS IS HOW TEAM#0 WORKS

For the second delivery, we once again list important files that document the evidence of all the points required in the rubric, adding one more compared to the previous delivery, "Act#5_Design", the listing by number aims to visualize the order to work on the activities.

- Act#1_Project description
- Act#2_Managment
- Act#3_Functional requirements
- Act#4_Non-functional requirements
- Act#5_Design
- Act#6_Presentation
- Act#7_Competences

This time we will try to replicate the **SCRUM** agile methodology for work, where we will divide the tasks into "*documentation*" (essential for the organization and documentation in the repository) or "*backlog*" (functional requirements in user stories), at the beginning of each period (approximately only 3) the tasks are created and divided among the members, where the aim is to work a little and enough of all the 7 activities, "fill the tanks little by little", in order to visualize as quickly as possible the structure of the documentation, complexity and effectiveness of the project that we are going to deliver, visualize the tasks where we are behind and better control the development of the project.

It is expected that the team members know about their assignments, start the doubts or the work from the first moment, we then work with the understanding of the total idea of ​​the contribution and the planned project, as well as the correct fullfilment of our periods . To accredit complete qualification of the project, the members must develop their assignments for the Period in the entire time that is established for it, it is not specified that they must finish it because there may be delays and the Period does not wait for anyone, as long as it is demonstrated that was attempted within the established time, the members credit points, otherwise when the task was delayed in starting to be developed, the contribution is not credited. The project may not be developed in 100 points, but the number of points generated at the end will represent the completed project.

It is intended that the leader, and it would be preferable that the rest of the members as well, be always willing to help the members with the development and understanding of the tasks, this is a disciplinary task and although the first one could contribute with some parts of certain tasks, It does not credit and reduces the contribution of those assigned if it is verified that it was full help and those assigned were able to continue with the task correctly, otherwise, it is clear that the points are credited by those responsible for completing the task, even if they are not the assigned ones.
