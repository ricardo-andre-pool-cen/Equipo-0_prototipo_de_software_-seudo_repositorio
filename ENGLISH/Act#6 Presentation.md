# How can the ideas go?
In this presentation it is suggested that 3 members of the team present it where each member would have to do one of the three phases of the video, the member would record his part of the script in the place he prefers, as long as he is professional and has a correct pronunciation of the English language.
Where the content I suggest it is in this order.
# How can the information go

# First phase.
First we will start by talking about our team work.

The Documentation, Backlog, Todo, In progress, In review and Does sections were created in the activities_team#0_Second_Delivery section within the repository where the team leader assigned activities to the members, so that the members were independent and carried out the activities in their own time organization, said activities had a list of requirements included to be accepted as an activity correctly carried out, a general requirement in each activity was to translate said activity into the English language and add it to its corresponding folder, just as the team members made a daily log of their activities in the project carried out during their day, each member added their activities and logs in their personal branch, later they created their pull request, where a quality test was carried out by the leader, this, upon approving said pull request, proceeded to the implementation of said activity in the corresponding second delivery branch.
Note: this text covers a pronunciation time in the English language of 57 seconds, according to data thrown by my stopwatch.
# Second phase.
The second section would be the evolution of the product.
In this section, a summary of the changes completed in the product between the first and second release will be described. Briefly mention the most significant changes and for which there is evidence.
# Third phase.
In the third section, the requirements will be discussed.
In this section, the evolution of the requirements and the refinement of the artifacts will be addressed:
- Where the evolution of requirements will cover the best defined and organized set of requirements (Functional and Non-Functional) with respect to the previous release.
- In the artifact refinement section, we will talk about the conversion of the functional requirements to user stories.

Note: phase 2 and phase 3 will have a maximum delivery time of 4 minutes (since the first phase covers almost 1 minute).
# Rhythm.
This script will be adapted to a maximum time of 5 minutes and in the English language for the opportunity of extra points, where visual support means will be used, such as balanced slides, uniform audio, with a balanced rhythm, where there are small pauses when speaking, thus being a flow that allows to clearly understand the development of the project.
