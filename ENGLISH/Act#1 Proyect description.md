## PROCESS DESCRIPTION, THIS IS HOW TEAM#0 WORKS

For the second delivery, we once again list important files that document the evidence of all the points required in the rubric, adding one more compared to the previous delivery, "Act#5_Design", the listing by number aims to visualize the order to work on the activities.

- Act#1_Project description
- Act#2_Managment
- Act#3_Functional requirements
- Act#4_Non-functional requirements
- Act#5_Design
- Act#6_Presentation
- Act#7_Competences

This time we will try to replicate the **SCRUM** agile methodology for work, where we will divide the tasks into "*documentation*" (essential for the organization and documentation in the repository) or "*backlog*" (functional requirements in user stories), at the beginning of each period (approximately only 3) the tasks are created and divided among the members, where the aim is to work a little and enough of all the 7 activities, "fill the tanks little by little", in order to visualize as quickly as possible the structure of the documentation, complexity and effectiveness of the project that we are going to deliver, visualize the tasks where we are behind and better control the development of the project.

It is expected that the team members know about their assignments, start the doubts or the work from the first moment, we then work with the understanding of the total idea of ​​the contribution and the planned project, as well as the correct fullfilment of our periods . To accredit complete qualification of the project, the members must develop their assignments for the Period in the entire time that is established for it, it is not specified that they must finish it because there may be delays and the Period does not wait for anyone, as long as it is demonstrated that was attempted within the established time, the members credit points, otherwise when the task was delayed in starting to be developed, the contribution is not credited. The project may not be developed in 100 points, but the number of points generated at the end will represent the completed project.

It is intended that the leader, and it would be preferable that the rest of the members as well, be always willing to help the members with the development and understanding of the tasks, this is a disciplinary task and although the first one could contribute with some parts of certain tasks, It does not credit and reduces the contribution of those assigned if it is verified that it was full help and those assigned were able to continue with the task correctly, otherwise, it is clear that the points are credited by those responsible for completing the task, even if they are not the assigned ones.

### TOOLS

## PROYECT DESCRIPTION

### THE PROBLEM

There is a need for an information organization system at an early stage of education, services such as Teams or Onedrive can store information of assignments and documents of students and the public, but its management lacks a solid structure for projects, not as Github, that’s the importance of repositories for the development of a project, however these tools for repositories are too difficult to understand for the majority of people who are not within this work environment with digital and professional tools . The design of Github is very good but it lacks the scope to adapt to a younger or less experienced audience, it does not offer direct help where the user can learn on their own.

### SOLUTION PROPOSITION: THE SEUDO-REPOSITORY

This is a service of individual and group proyect managing, where there are available different tools of universal use, which simulate the main functions for a professional repository, and intends to help students to understand the vitality and practice the storage of a work in a digital organization tool.

The system contains a lot of functions: name and proyect description, leader and members, roles per individual competencies, list of materials, tasks and goals, schedules and dailys, documentation, editing online files with more than one member at time; from where the user is guided to learn to use the work space during an onboarding method, at the same time, he gets taught about the beginning of professional managing of works inside a digital tool for process efectivity.

It is proposed to be used mainly for medium and high school students, however, this software is universal and can be used by any person in any work that the user or group needs, the system can be adapted based on what the user wants to work.

### OBJECTIVE

The implementation of a tool that simulates the workspace of professional repositories such as Github is required, but is built with functions more limited to the development of the project and not to the business or job environment, that is, the program will not have as many information squares that are irrelevant to the user who uses it. This program will educate inexperienced people to learn about the environment of group projects managed under digital tools. The interactive “Onboarding” style guide is effective in encouraging the user to learn to use our tool, literally, using it for all its purposes without the need for a third party, only guided by the system. Once the user masters the use of our program, they can move on to use other more professional programs, so this is where the usefulness of this program is intended to end.

### USERS

This system is pretended to be used by people who:

- Are involved in development of projects that need essencial documentation
- Are not learning another more professional tool such as Github

#### PRIMARY: *mid and high-school students who prefer to improve the monitoring of their tasks.*
